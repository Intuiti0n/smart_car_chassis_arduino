Features:
* This Car Chassis Kits can be a good DIY choice for you at home
* 100% Brand new and high quality
* 20 line Speed Encoder, more accurate than 6 or 10 one.
* The mechanical structure is simple, convenient installation.
* The height between two chassis can be change by different copper pillar.
* The four turn speed dc motor flexible, directional well. Quad, chronological horsepower. Chassis and stability is very easy to extend
* The car comes with speed encoder, cooperate with our speed of photoelectric, can rapidly form a speed measuring system. Can speed, range, form a closed loop system.
