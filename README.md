<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>
* This Car Chassis Kits can be a good DIY choice for you at home<br>
* 100% Brand new and high quality<br>
* 20 line Speed Encoder, more accurate than 6 or 10 one.<br>
* The mechanical structure is simple, convenient installation.<br>
* The height between two chassis can be change by different copper pillar.<br>
* The four turn speed dc motor flexible, directional well. Quad, chronological horsepower. Chassis and stability is very easy to extend<br>
* The car comes with speed encoder, cooperate with our speed of photoelectric, can rapidly form a speed measuring system. Can speed, range, form a closed loop system.<br>
